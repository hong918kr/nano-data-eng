# Data Modeling with Postgres

This is the first project in Data Engineering Nano Degree.
Here is the list of concept we need.

    - Create Tables
        1. Data Modeling with Postgres
        2. Create Database Star Schema
    - Build ETL Process
    - Build ETL Pipeline
    - Document Process


### Goal





### Database Schema Design

Two type of table consists in this project:
    - FACT table - "songplays", pointing each dimension table below
    - DIMENSION tables - "users", "songs", "artists" and "time table"
    
   
### ETL Pipeline





# Process

    1. Write Create staements in sql_queries.py to create each table.
    2. Write Drop statements in sql_queries.py to drop each table if it exists.
    3. Run create_tables.py to create my database and tables.
    4. Run test.ipynb to confirm the creation of my tables with the correct columns.
    
    5. Follw instructions in the etl.ipynb notebook to develop ETL processes for each table.
        - Fill out INSERT record in sql_queries.py 
        -
